### Precautions [The following instructions are long, please read them carefully before use]
- Some functions only take effect in versions v4.3.003591.0 (220326-220501) and v4.3004561.0 (220809). The specific functions will be explained in the update log of this version
- Some versions only have basic functions. Usually, "this version does not have full function" will be added to this version (such as the new version of the model watermark/KinoUI)
- Master lenses are only available on Leica cameras, this feature is extremely unstable, so no feedback on this feature is accepted
- Some models with video HDR/Super Anti-Shake function have been deleted from the unsupported models due to the fact that the hardware does not support it. Although the imposed function is switched on, it may cause serious heat and power consumption problems.
- The feature of silent street shooting and street shooting video mode can only be used in the EU modified version (the street shooting function has been removed from the Leica version because it is unavailable)
- Some functions on the setting page may only be switches, please test by yourself, and do not accept feedback on such problems
