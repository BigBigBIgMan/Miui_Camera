- v4.3.003591.0 (220501) Other models: **Xiaomi 10T/Xiaomi 10T Pro/Redmi K30S** (Apollo/Apollo_Pro)
- The other models listed above should not be added in future releases unless on a whim or with major revisions
- The newly launched Mi 12 series / Redmi K50 series and other models have officially applied the new watermark by default. 3591 (220501) version, added KinoUI interface (cupid/zeus/psyche/ingres) for Xiaomi Mi 12 series and Redmi K50G. )
- Some models with Video HDR/Super Image Stabilization have been removed from unsupported models due to unsupported hardware. It can cause serious thermal and power consumption issues when the forcing function is turned on and off.
- Since I haven't tested it on every model, if there is a problem with the function (especially the model watermark), please don't hesitate to report it, thank you~

### Instructions for use
- After flashing the module through magisk, restart the phone to use
- Only supports MIUI12.5 development version and above models
- The stable version after MIUI13 v4.3.003591.0 can be used normally, the previous version will definitely crash
- MIUI ROMs ported by third parties cannot be used (ported to mobile phones or other brands of mobile phones)
- You can use the xiaomi.eu ROM, the rest are subject to the official self-test of the adapted ROM
