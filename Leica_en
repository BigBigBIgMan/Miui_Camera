## Notes on Leica cameras
Applicable versions: 4660, 4700, 4750, 4780, 4790, 4870

You choose to install the Leica camera of this project as if you have read all warnings on this project (including the following),
Installing this item may result in "Cammy" or "Camera Lost"
If you don't know what Kami is and don't know how to save bricks, we strongly advise you not to use this mod!

By installing this module, you will be able to enjoy the exclusive Leica features of the Mi 12S series
Included: Leica Classic, Leica Vivid Photo Style options can be turned on! (The default photo mode is Leica Vivid)
And in the filter options you will be able to use four additional Leica effects (including: Leica Vivid, Leica Natural, Leica Monochrome, Leica Monochrome HC)
In addition, Leica's exclusive custom watermark can be activated!
As for whether the image quality of the photo has been improved, we will wait for you to experience it. The Leica algorithm is definitely there!

In order to avoid problems, we recommend that you unzip the camera APK in the package (located in system/app/MiuiCamera.apk) and install it directly by cracking the core
You can use woobox and other software with the core cracking function to perform the "five-item full-open" installation. If you don't know what it means, it is not recommended for you to use it!
â€»Note: Please make sure that your camera version is lower than the corresponding Leica camera version. It is recommended that you flash the 3591 stable version first and then try the core crack installation!

Since this project is not officially allowed by Xiaomi, and the official still tries its best to prevent the installation and distribution of models other than the 12S series
**This item is for academic use only, please remove it within 24 hours after use. **

## About the Leica Camera Completion Project
Applicable versions: 4700, 4790 (unpublished), 4870 (unpublished)

At present, we have tried to complete the functions mentioned in the project for Leica cameras.
However, based on the particularity of the camera, it cannot perfectly complement all functions.
For the time being, there are only a few versions available for you to experience some functions that are "officially stated that the hardware does not support" on your model.
The specific open function will be notified on the download page of the release!

Some unpublished versions are not available for download because they have the wisdom of others (the author is not the only one)! (Only available to a small number of loyal users, if necessary, you can add LINE official account @doh0596a)
